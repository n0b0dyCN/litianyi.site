## About Me

I'm Tianyi Li, a blockchain security engineer at [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/).

Previous to that, I was a senior security engineer at Antgroup, designed and implemented high performance MPC computation system.

I received my Bachelor and Master degree at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology (WICT)](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/) of [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).
My research includes browser fingerprinting and it's detection techniques.
I also worked on web security, privacy enhancing technologies and program (JavaScript and linux binary) analysis.
I was a member of CTF team [r3kapig](https://r3kapig.com/) (ID: n0b0dy), and I mainly focus on web challenges.

I’m interested in music.
I have participated in the rehearsal of the PKU EECS chorus competition for 7 years ([link](https://eecs129.site/)), and I sing as Base in the choir.
I’m also interested in Chinese opera.
