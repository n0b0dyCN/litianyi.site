## About Me

I'm Tianyi Li, a third-year master student at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology (WICT)](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/) of [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).
My research interests include security, privacy and program analysis.
I am a member of CTF team [r3kapig](https://r3kapig.com/) (ID: n0b0dy), and I mainly focus on web challenges.

I’m interested in music.
I have participated in the rehearsal of the PKU EECS chorus competition for 7 years ([link](https://eecs129.site/)), and I sing as Base in the choir.
I’m also interested in Chinese opera.
